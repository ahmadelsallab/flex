    "# Concept\n",
    "FLEX is a framework to organize the running of ML experiments, and make them reproducible, by tracking their configurations.\n",
    "The philosophy of FLEX is to keep the main components of an ML programs as re-usable plugins.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define an ML Experiment to be composed of:\n",
    "- Data loaders: loading and generating the data.\n",
    "- Data pre-processors: data preparation and features processing. \n",
    "- Models: networks, classifiers,..etc.\n",
    "- Learners: training procedure.\n",
    "- Configurations: meta data, hyper parameters, results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the above components, can be re-used across different experiments.\n",
    "Moreover, the mixture of them forms an experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "## _\"FLEX is FLEXible_\"\n",
    "You can use FLEX in many different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For managing experiments configurations and reproducing results.\n",
    "- For wrapping and deploying ML models.\n",
    "- For running standard experiments and re-using models, data,...etc across different experiments. framework.\n",
    "- No binding to specific framework.\n",
    "- Can work with any remote git server.\n",
    "- Flexibe API's.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the package called \"flex\", you will find base classes that implements standard interfaces for:\n",
    "- Data loading \n",
    "- Data pre-processing\n",
    "- Models building\n",
    "- Training (Learners)\n",
    "- Deployment as an App\n",
    "\n",
    "All the library is \"framework agnostic\", meaning, DL frameworks like Keras, Pytorch, ...etc are just plugins to FLEX.\n",
    "It's not mandatory to use all the base classes, meaning, you can still use most of the features if you implement your own.\n",
    "But we encourage to follow the same structure in order to have organized and easy flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Folders structure\n",
    "We have provided an example folder for the best folder structure to use FLEX.\n",
    "However, this structure is not mandatory; you still can use some features like configuration management without that structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure is described here:\n",
    "- configs: contains the different configurations of different experiments using the Configuration base class.\n",
    "- data: contains custom re-usable loaders and pre-processors\n",
    "- models: contains the different custom re-usable models\n",
    "- runs: contains the different experiments and deployment apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use cases\n",
    "In the following we will demo some use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "More use cases under the example/notebooks.\n",
    "## Configuration management of experiments\n",
    "In machine learning you perform many experiments until you settle on a good model. During this journey you have a lot of checkpoints, visualizations, results,...etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logger helps you to organize and keep track of:\n",
    "- The experiments results\n",
    "- TODO: The model checkpoints\n",
    "- TODO: Different visualizations and curves\n",
    "\n",
    "More use cases under tests/test_experiment.py\n",
    "\n",
    "### Log new experiment result\n",
    "In general any experiment is composed of:\n",
    "- meta_data: name, purpose, file, commit,...etc\n",
    "- config: mostly the hyperparameters, and any other configuration like the used features. For deep learning, config can be further divided into: data, model, optimizer, learning hyper parameters\n",
    "- results: metrics, best model file, comment,..etc\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose all your previous records are in 'results_old.csv'.\n",
    "\n",
    "And now you want to log a new experiment results.\n"
